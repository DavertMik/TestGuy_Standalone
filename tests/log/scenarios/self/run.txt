I WANT TO TEST RUNNING A TEST SUITE

I execute "php testguy.php run self build"
I see in output "test build command"
I see in output "TestGuy 0.7"
I see in output "OK (1 test"

...I am going to check generation of html output 
I execute "php testguy.php run self build --html"
I see file found ["result.html","tests/log"]
I see in file "TestGuy Results"
